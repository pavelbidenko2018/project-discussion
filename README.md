    Want to find the most suiting secondary school for their son (without spending too much time and effort on it) based on the following criteria:
    - Geographical position
    - Language of studying
    - Type of school (state, private, international)
    - Orientation (general, technical, vocational, art)
    - Ratings from other users (possible)
